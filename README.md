### Seed: Input custom seed in the "SEED" box.
### Aspect Ratio: "RES" for custom aspect ratio for example "4:5" and use the dropdown lists to select resolutions.

### Second tab: Use the "Automatic Prompts" tab at the bottom to change tabs
## Settings:
### Add: Click add to open a window to add a prompt to the list, left side to pick from saved prompts or you can type a new prompt.
### Update/Delete: Click on any prompt saved to the list to open a window to update/delete a prompt.
### Delay/Repeat/Start/Stop: Delay(Seconds) between prompts sent to discord, Repeat(Number of times to repeat each prompt on the list) and use Start and Stop to start sending prompts to discord. I noticed a issue with discord slow mode counting down from 1 minute but pausing every so often so you will need something like 70 second delay for now.
